# Week X: Worksheet

(Note - use normal model and extended thinking with latest sonnet)

Based on the attached lecture file - please generate a downloadable markdown worksheet that contains two sections - a quiz section and a task section as follows:

## Quiz Section

The quiz section should contain 4 questions, organised as follows:

* 2 should be in cloze format with scrambled word bank and 
* 2 should be multiple choice.

The quiz questions should be relevant to the lecture content and should test the student's understanding of the material covered in the lecture. The questions should be clear and concise, and should be appropriate for students at an introductory level of programming.

The quiz questions should be in markdown format, with appropriate headings and subheadings to organize the content. Use bullet points and numbered lists where appropriate to make the content easy to read and understand. Use ascci for diagrams where appropriate to illustrate concepts.

The quiz questions should be designed to be completed within a reasonable amount of time, such as 5 to 10 minutes for the entire quiz.

## Task Section

The task section should contain 2 tasks, organised as follows:

Provide two code tasks based on the lecture topics - that are not in the lecture notes or the tutorial.  The tasks should be relevant to the lecture content and should test the student's understanding of the material covered in the lecture. The tasks should be clear and concise, and should be appropriate for students at an introductory level of programming. They can be more challenging than the tutorial tasks - but should not be too difficult. 

For each task - provide some code scaffolding to help the student get started and sample input and output.

These tasks should take approximately 5-10 minutes each.



## Answers

Please provide the answers to both the quiz section and the tasks section in a separate downloadable markdown file.

## Note
* Do not provide place for  students to enter their information or any other personal data in the worksheet.
* Do not provide submission instructions or guidelines in the worksheet.
* The worksheet heading should just contain the title "Lecture X: `Kotlin` Worksheet" - do not include any other information in the heading.
* Do not mention the word "cloze" or similar in the worksheet.
