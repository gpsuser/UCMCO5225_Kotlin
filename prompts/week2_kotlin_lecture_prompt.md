# Lecture prompt

## Note - use explanatory setting and extended thinking


## Task

"
As an expert `kotlin` programming lecturer, you are tasked with creating a lecture content for a lecture session. 

This lecture content will follow (guided by) the attached lecture slide content: `2_Kotlin functions.pdf` and `2_Classes.pdf` - with the functions content coming first. 

You may rely on external sources to enhance the content of the lecture, but ensure that the lecture includes (at the very least) all the contents from the slide decks.

Ignore tasks and quizzes - there will be separate prompts for these.

The lecture content should be broken down into sections, with each section having a title and a brief description of what will be covered in that section - followed by explanation and examples. 

* All code examples and code snippets must be in `kotlin` and must represent complete programs that can run - and if necessary include an entry point (`main()) and  related dependencies (import statements etc.). 

Properly comment the code to explain what each part does.

Try and provide snippets of sample output for each program where appropriate.

The sections should be ordered in a logical sequence that builds upon the previous sections.

The lecture content should be detailed enough to cover the allocated lecture time, but not so detailed that it becomes overwhelming. 

Aim for a balance between depth and breadth of coverage.
"

## Format
"
The lecture content should be written in markdown format, with appropriate headings and subheadings to organize the content. 

Use bullet points and numbered lists where appropriate to make the content easy to read and understand. 

Use ascci art for diagrams where appropriate to illustrate concepts.
"


## Tone
"
Write in an explanatory teacher tone .
"

## Audience
"
Write for learners who are from different backgrounds and have varying needs, and are studing for an undergraduate degree in computer science.
"

## Scope

"
The lecture session is 55 minutes long. 
"

## Steps to include

"
At the start of the lecture there should be:
* a table of contents listing sections/topics with time allocations for each section 
* a table of objectives (SMART) and 
* a table of learning outcomes

At the end of the lecture there should be: 
* a time allocation summary table by section/topic with learning outcomes (LO1, LO2, etc.).

Finally, the lecture content should include a list of resources for further reading and practice, such as online tutorials, documentation, and coding challenges.

Do not mention pre-requisites or preparation for future lectures (or similar)
