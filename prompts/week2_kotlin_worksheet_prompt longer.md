# Week 3: Worksheet

Based on the attached lecture file and tutorial file - please generate a downloadable markdown worksheet that contains three sections - a quiz section, a task section, and a summary table section as follows:

## Quiz Section

The quiz section should contain 4 questions, organised as follows:

* 2 should be in cloze format with scrambled word bank and 
* 2 should be multiple choice.

The quiz questions should be relevant to the lecture content and should test the student's understanding of the material covered in the lecture. The questions should be clear and concise, and should be appropriate for students at an introductory level of programming.

The quiz questions should be in markdown format, with appropriate headings and subheadings to organize the content. Use bullet points and numbered lists where appropriate to make the content easy to read and understand. Use ascci art for diagrams where appropriate to illustrate concepts.

The quiz questions should be designed to be completed within a reasonable amount of time, such as 5 to 10 minutes for the entire quiz.

## Task Section

The task section should contain 2 tasks, organised as follows:

Provide two code tasks based on the lecture topics - that are not in the lecture notes or the tutorial.  The tasks should be relevant to the lecture content and should test the student's understanding of the material covered in the lecture. The tasks should be clear and concise, and should be appropriate for students at an introductory level of programming. They can be more challenging than the tutorial tasks - but should not be too difficult. 

For each task - provide some code scaffolding to help the student get started and sample input and output.

These tasks should take approximately 5-10 minutes each.

## Summary Table

At the end of the worksheet - please provide a summary table that maps lecture topics to relevant tutorial tasks in the tutorial file `cpp_programming_tutorial.pdf`.

* Only show lecture topics for which tasks can be found.
* Only reference a task once - even if it is relevant to multiple lecture topics.
* If a lecture topic has multiple relevant tasks - show all of them.

## Answers

Please provide the answers to both the quiz section and the tasks section in a separate downloadable markdown file.

## Note
* Do not provide place for  students to enter their information or any other personal data in the worksheet.
* Do not provide submission instructions or guidelines in the worksheet.
* The worksheet heading should just contain the title "Lecture X: Python Worksheet" - do not include any other information in the heading.
* Do not mention the word "cloze" or similar in the worksheet.
