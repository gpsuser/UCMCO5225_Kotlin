    "Note: If you are using an older version of Ubuntu or if you specifically need the Python 2 version (which is strongly discouraged), you would use python-pip, but for modern development, always use python3-pip.\n",

    "💡 Best Practice: Use Virtual Environments\n",
    "While you can now install packages globally using pip3 install <package_name>, it's highly recommended to use virtual environments. Virtual environments isolate your project dependencies, preventing conflicts between different projects and keeping your system-wide Python clean.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create and use a virtual environment, follow these steps after installing python3-pip:\n",
    "\n",
    "Install python3-venv (usually installed with python3-pip, but good to check):\n",
    "\n",
    "sudo apt install python3-venv\n",
    "Navigate to your project directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a virtual environment (named .venv in this example):\n",
    "\n",
    "python3 -m venv .venv\n",
    "Activate the virtual environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "source .venv/bin/activate\n",
    "Your terminal prompt should now show the name of your environment (e.g., (.venv)), indicating it's active.\n",
    "\n",
    "Install packages using pip (not pip3 or sudo):\n",
    "\n",
    "pip install numpy pandas\n",
    "When the virtual environment is active, using the simple pip command will automatically use the pip associated with that environment and install packages locally within it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Would you like me to show you how to set up your project directory in WSL and create a virtual environment?"
